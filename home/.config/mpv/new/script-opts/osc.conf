# layout
# Default: bottombar
# The layout for the OSC. Currently available are: box, slimbox, bottombar and topbar. Default pre-0.21.0 was 'box'.
layout=bottombar

# seekbarstyle
# Default: bar
# Sets the style of the playback position marker and overall shape of the seekbar: bar, diamond or knob.
seekbarstyle=bar

# seekbarhandlesize
# Default: 0.6
# Size ratio of the seek handle if seekbarstyle is set to dimaond or knob. This is relative to the full height of the seekbar.
seekbarhandlesize=0.6

# seekbarkeyframes
# Default: yes
# Controls the mode used to seek when dragging the seekbar (default: true). If set to true, default seeking mode is used (usually keyframes, but player defaults and heuristics can change it to exact). If set to false, exact seeking on mouse drags will be used instead. Keyframes are preferred, but exact seeks may be useful in cases where keyframes cannot be found. Note that using exact seeks can potentially make mouse dragging much slower.
#seekbarkeyframes=yes

# seekrangestyle
# Default: inverted
# Display seekable ranges on the seekbar. bar shows them on the full height of the bar, line as a thick line and inverted as a thin line that is inverted over playback position markers. none will hide them. Additionally, slider will show a permanent handle inside the seekbar with cached ranges marked inside. Note that these will look differently based on the seekbarstyle option. Also, slider does not work with seekbarstyle set to bar.
#seekrangestyle=inverted

# seekrangeseparate
# Default: yes
# Controls whether to show line-style seekable ranges on top of the seekbar or separately if seekbarstyle is set to bar.
#seekrangeseparate=yes

# seekrangealpha
# Default: 200
# Alpha of the seekable ranges, 0 (opaque) to 255 (fully transparent).
seekrangealpha=200

# deadzonesize
# Default: 0.5
# Size of the deadzone. The deadzone is an area that makes the mouse act like leaving the window. Movement there won't make the OSC show up and it will hide immediately if the mouse enters it. The deadzone starts at the window border opposite to the OSC and the size controls how much of the window it will span. Values between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0 means the OSC will always popup with mouse movement in the window, and 1 means the OSC will only show up when the mouse hovers it. Default pre-0.21.0 was 0.
#deadzonesize=0.5

# minmousemove
# Default: 0
# Minimum amount of pixels the mouse has to move between ticks to make the OSC show up. Default pre-0.21.0 was 3.
#minmousemove=0

# showwindowed
# Default: yes
# Enable the OSC when windowed
#showwindowed=yes

# showfullscreen
# Default: yes
# Enable the OSC when fullscreen
#showfullscreen=yes

# scalewindowed
# Default: 1.0
# Scale factor of the OSC when windowed.
#scalewindowed=1.0

# scalefullscreen
# Default: 1.0
# Scale factor of the OSC when fullscreen
#scalefullscreen=1.0

# scaleforcedwindow
# Default: 2.0
# Scale factor of the OSC when rendered on a forced (dummy) window
#scaleforcedwindow=2.0

# vidscale
# Default: yes
# Scale the OSC with the video no tries to keep the OSC size constant as much as the window size allows
#vidscale=yes

# valign
# Default: 0.8
# Vertical alignment, -1 (top) to 1 (bottom)
#valign=0.8

# halign
# Default: 0.0
# Horizontal alignment, -1 (left) to 1 (right)
#halign=0.0

# barmargin
# Default: 0
# Margin from bottom (bottombar) or top (topbar), in pixels
barmargin=0

# boxalpha
# Default: 80
# Alpha of the background box, 0 (opaque) to 255 (fully transparent)
boxalpha=80

# hidetimeout
# Default: 500
# Duration in ms until the OSC hides if no mouse movement, must not be negative
#hidetimeout=500

# fadeduration
# Default: 200
# Duration of fade out in ms, 0 = no fade
#fadeduration=200

# title
# Default: ${media-title}
# String that supports property expansion that will be displayed as OSC title. ASS tags are escaped, and newlines and trailing slashes are stripped.
#title=${media-title}

# tooltipborder
# Default: 1
# Size of the tooltip outline when using bottombar or topbar layouts
#tooltipborder=1

# timetotal
# Default: no
# Show total time instead of time remaining
#timetotal=no

# timems
# Default: no
# Display timecodes with milliseconds
#timems=no

# visibility
# Default: auto (auto hide/show on mouse move)
# Also supports never and always
#visibility=auto

# boxmaxchars
# Default: 80
# Max chars for the osc title at the box layout. mpv does not measure the text width on screen and so it needs to limit it by number of chars. The default is conservative to allow wide fonts to be used without overflow. However, with many common fonts a bigger number can be used. YMMV.
#boxmaxchars=80

# boxvideo
# Default: no
# Whether to overlay the osc over the video (no), or to box the video within the areas not covered by the osc (yes). If this option is set, the osc may overwrite the --video-margin-ratio-* options, even if the user has set them. (It will not overwrite them if all of them are set to default values.) Additionally, visibility must be set to always. Otherwise, this option does nothing.
# Currently, this is supported for the bottombar and topbar layout only. The other layouts do not change if this option is set. Separately, if window controls are present (see below), they will be affected regardless of which osc layout is in use.
# The border is static and appears even if the OSC is configured to appear only on mouse interaction. If the OSC is invisible, the border is simply filled with the background color (black by default).
# This currently still makes the OSC overlap with subtitles (if the --sub-use-margins option is set to yes, the default). This may be fixed later.
# This does not work correctly with video outputs like --vo=xv, which render OSD into the unscaled video.
#boxvideo=no

# windowcontrols
# Default: auto (Show window controls if there is no window border)
# Whether to show window management controls over the video, and if so, which side of the window to place them. This may be desirable when the window has no decorations, either because they have been explicitly disabled (border=no) or because the current platform doesn't support them (eg: gnome-shell with wayland).
# The set of window controls is fixed, offering minimize, maximize, and quit. Not all platforms implement minimize and maximize, but quit will always work.
#windowcontrols=auto

# windowcontrols_alignment
# Default: right
# If window controls are shown, indicates which side should they be aligned to.
# Supports left and right which will place the controls on those respective sides.
#windowcontrols_alignment=right

# greenandgrumpy
# Default: no
# Set to yes to reduce festivity (i.e. disable santa hat in December.)
greenandgrumpy=yes
